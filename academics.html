The Celestial Buds High school's program focuses on preparing students for admission to college and university programs.  Our high school students develop academic skills, self-advocacy and self-confidence and are provided with extensive college counseling that supports them through the entire college search and application process. We encourage students to explore their interests and career options through its annual high school internship program.<br>

With small classes averaging 10 students or fewer, dialogue between teachers and students serves as the primary teaching method.  Multisensory, hands-on, experiential learning in seminar-style classes with daily discussions form the core of our approach. Teachers use technology extensively, including multimedia which play to the students' visual strengths.  The high school also incorporates an extensive guest speaker program which bolsters interest in and understanding of core curriculum.
Our classes include language-based learning strategies in all subject areas. Special attention is paid to:-<br><br>
<p style="font-size: 25px;color:brown">1) Reading (fluency and comprehension).</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 25px;color:brown">2) Writing.</p><br>
<p style="font-size: 25px;color:brown">3) Organizational skills and executive functioning/planning
Specific, structured approaches to assignments including research.</p><br>

During daily tutorial periods, high school students receive supplemental help in reading, writing and math.<br>  

In addition to mathematics, science, and humanities classes, We offers a range of arts, music, foreign language, and physical education offerings.  All high school students at Here learn Arabic.  Arabic courses are founded in vocabulary, culture and conversation, rather than writing skills, thus capitalizing on the strengths of our students.  As students enter their final year of high school, they are encouraged to explore areas of significant interest through year-long independent projects.<br>

The Celestial Buds High School values an integrated curriculum. Courses in history and literature are connected thematically and topically and other subjects draw on themes and topics covered in the humanities.  For example, History 9 begins with a study of the Great Depression while English 9 students read Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. Concurrently, students might analyze the New Deal photographs of Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and others.  Efforts are made to connect math and science courses, both vertically through a student's time at Here and horizontally through a year's curriculum.<br>
